# 11. Getting Started

To start your project, enter the following command in your terminal:

```
npx @hotsixman/xvelte {project directory}
```

If you do not enter a project path, it will be created in a folder named `project`.

## Project Structure
```
├─src
│  ├─app.html
│  ├─app.ts
│  └─env.d.ts
├─static
├─.gitignore
├─package.json
├─tsconfig.json
└─vite.config.ts
```

- `src`: This folder contains the main files for the project. You can create a `routes` folder inside it for file-system based routing to create pages and endpoints. (See [Page Routing](./21. Page Routing.md) and [Endpoint Routing](./22. Endpoint Routing.md))
    - `app.ts`: The main file of the application.
    - `app.html`: The default HTML template to be used.
    - `env.d.ts`: Type definition file.
- `static`: A folder for static file routing.
