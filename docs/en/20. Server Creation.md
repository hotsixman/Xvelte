# Server Creation

An Xvelte server can be created as follows.
```ts
// src/app.ts
import XvelteApp from '@hotsixman/xvelte';
import template from './app.html?raw';

const app = new XvelteApp(template);

export default app.handler;

if(import.env.meta.PROD){
    app.listen(3000);
}
```

`src/app.ts` must export the handler as the default. Otherwise, you cannot use Vite's development server. It is also necessary when using services like Vercel.

## Template

`src/app.html` is written like this by default.
```html
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <xvelte-head></xvelte-head>
    </head>
    <body>
        <xvelte-body></xvelte-body>
    </body>
</html>
```

You can modify it if needed, but `<xvelte-head>` inside the `head` and `<xvelte-body>` inside the `body` are essential. The HTML for each page will be injected into these parts during the SSR phase.

## Routing
```ts
// src/app.ts
...
// Page Routing
app.page('/', (event) => {
    const currentTime = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
    return {
        component: Index,
        props: {
            currentTime
        }
    }
});
// Endpoint Routing
app.post('/submit', async (event) => {
    const requestBody = await event.json();
    await db.upload(requestBody);

    event.status = 200;
    event.cookie.set('submit', 'true');

    return 'success';
})
...
```
For more details, please refer to [Page Routing](./21.%20Page%20Routing.md) and [Endpoint Routing](./22.%20Endpoint%20Routing.md).

## Hooks

Xvelte provides a `hook` feature that allows you to insert custom logic into the request processing pipeline. Hooks are useful for performing common tasks before any route handlers are executed, such as authentication, logging, or adding common data to the request object. Hooks are executed immediately after a `RequestEvent` object is created upon receiving a request.

You can register a hook using the `app.hook()` method.

```ts
// src/app.ts
app.hook(async (event) => {
  // This runs for every request.
  console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] ${event.method.toUpperCase()} ${event.url.pathname}`);

  const session = await getSessionFromCookie(event.cookie.get('sessionId'));
  if (!session && event.url.pathname.startsWith('/admin')) {
    // If there is no session when accessing an admin page, redirect to the login page.
    event.status = 302;
    event.setHeader('Location', '/login');
    return ''; // Immediately ends the response.
  }

  // Add user information to event.locals to be used in subsequent handlers.
  event.locals.user = session?.user;

  // To continue to the next hook or route handler, you must return the event object.
  return event;
});
```

The hook function receives the `RequestEvent` object as an argument.

-   Within a hook function, you can modify the `event` object and pass it to the next handler.
-   If the hook function returns a value other than the `event` object (such as a `string`, `null`, `Buffer`, etc.), it immediately responds to the client with that value and terminates the request processing. This is useful for short-circuiting or redirecting requests under certain conditions.
-   You can also execute multiple hooks sequentially using the `XvelteApp.sequence(...hooks)` function.
