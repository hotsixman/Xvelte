# 10. Introduction

Xvelte is a web application framework based on Svelte and Vite. It is based on Server-Side Rendering (SSR), while aiming to improve performance through Partial Hydration, or the Island Architecture, which selectively activates only the parts that require interaction.

While using Svelte's concise syntax, productive development is possible through features provided by Xvelte such as file-system based routing, server endpoints, and hooks.
